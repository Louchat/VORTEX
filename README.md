# VORTEX
Vortex is an open-source console based script that can open and installs apps and optimise your pc way more faster and easier than the Windows desktop can do by directly oppening them by their own path.

TO USE IT, YOU WILL NEED TO INSTALL 4 LIBRARIES WHILE USING THIS COMMAND: 

pip install keyboard pywin32 requests colorama

You will also need Python 3

enjoy :)
